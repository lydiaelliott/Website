  <left>Papa’s Sushiria: Game Analysis

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Do you find yourself lost in the notion that you are an unskilled video gamer?  This is not uncommon, because if you were never introduced to a video games as a kid or have only played Candy Crush on your mobile device, the games Grand Theft Auto and Destiny may be a tad confusing.  A wide variety of video games are entering the market for kids, teens, and even adults. One’s abilities to play video games, such as skill and patience, determine one’s decision for which games they choose to play.  Papa’s Sushiria, the game which shall be analyzed, is one that is easier to navigate for those individuals who are unfamiliar with games with a higher level of difficulty, and/or with many “bells and whistles.”</p>
<h2>Game Structure</h2>
<p>Papa's Sushiria, similar to the other Papa Louie games, offers a fun, animated, two-dimensional take on virtual cooking.  Papa’s Sushiria allows you to advance throughout the game by winning new customers, cooking materials, ingredients, recipes, and prizes such as clothing and restaurant decor.  The game begins with a slot (as shown in the images on the previous page) of which the player can choose, which is helpful if the player decides to have different characters (maximum of three main characters), because the player can then choose between three different games to play from.  After the player chooses a slot, they can either select a default character to play with (male or female), or the player can design a character.  After the player’s character is chosen, an animated introduction shows the character interacting with Papa Louie (which can be skipped if wanted).  Finally, the player receives a thorough walkthrough of each section of the cooking process: the order station, the cooking station, the build station, and the bubble-tea making station.  And then, the fun begins!</p>


<h2>Gaming Experience and Analysis</h2>
<p>While playing Papa’s Sushiria, I had a mostly positive, but a few negative experiences as I made my way through each level.
Papa’s Sushiria is based off of the common themes and actions seen/performed in other Papa Louie games.  Similar to how you can make a smoothie in Papa’s Sushiria, you can make a smoothie in another Papa Louie game.  This is important because it allows for players to become familiar with how the games are structured.  In Papa’s Sushiria, the player is to make specifically sushi.  Other Papa Louie games are dedicated to the “cooking” of smoothies, meatballs, chicken wings, donuts, or pizza.  Each game however, is designed to make only that one food type, making the game more consolidated for the player, because there is less to focus on.  This makes the early stages of the game boring, as the extended tutorial (which I will gladly explain about later in the section), cannot be skipped!</p>

<p>As explained in the game structure section, after the player chooses a slot, the player has the ability to design their own character if they wish to.  The design your own character feature not only adds and creates a player connection to the game, but also adds a sense of sophistication in the game, as other Cool Math Games (the website that contains this game) do not provide that option.</p>

<p>As a player experiencing the game for the first time, the game tutorial is very helpful, so that the player understands how to run each station. However, if you are someone that has played the game before and did not save a previous game, you have to wait for the tutorial to pass no matter what, which is a painstakingly long process.  If the game had a “skip tutorial” or similar button to avoid the tutorial, the game would be more user friendly.  Tutorials can be extremely beneficial, especially because some young adult/teen/adult games do not usually come with tutorials.  In addition, games with fancy commands and all sorts of strategies usually don’t explain how to use them.</p>

<p>Lastly, Papa’s Sushiria, unlike some cooking games like Cooking Mama, does not have an annoying image of a hand sticking out every time the player has to stir soup or roll dough.  However, due to the fact that Papa’s Sushiria is two-dimensional, the player has no sense of spatial area.  For example, when the player reaches the “building station,” they have to divide the sushi roll to be served.  There are lines presented on the cutting board and there is shadowing of the knife (as if there was light somewhere in the virtual kitchen), but when there are many customers, it is difficult to correctly cut the sushi to the desired size and be able to get a decent score at the end of the “day” (end of the level).</p>
<h2>Societal Impact and Relevance</h2>
<p>“To be or not to be, that is the question.”  Hamlet helps us to either realize that one, Papa’s Sushiria is a complete waste of time, or two, that it successfully recreates the multiple factors of societal culture and the people within it, in an animated, two-dimensional space.
Papa’s Sushiria and typical Papa Louie games incorporate cultural aspects of society that I never fully realized until I played it for this analysis.  I was able to recognize simple parts of the game like the emotional expressions on the faces of the characters/customers.  On a broader level, I could see how the game connects to the uniqueness of cultures in society through the food, and the “outdoor” space that is portrayed during the game, which shows buildings with architecture and design similar to that found in an Asian culture.  Papa’s Sushiria also connected to society through its continued use of multicultural/multiracial characters that all had different heights, weights, hairstyles, and even clothing; the entry of these characters into the game portray a happy and accepting society, as people from all backgrounds and lifestyles are coming together to basically, eat sushi.  The game even touched on people in our society that are of social hierarchy.  The food critics in the game (also known as the graders or people wearing blue ribbons with the stoic facial expressions), ordered specific meals that had to be prepared to perfection to receive their satisfaction.  Although I originally thought a game as simple as Papa’s Sushiria would have no relevance in today’s society, after my full analysis, I now realize that Papa’s Sushiria may be instilling in youth that play these sorts of games, the importance of exploring other cultures and being open to the world around us that we may be stubborn to look into.</p>
