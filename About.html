              This website was created to showcase the brilliant work done by Baxter students in the field of technology. With articles from the social construct displayed in video game culture to the games being created by our own students. With our goal building up student work we are constantly changing and updating to bring you the most accurate knowledge about what is going on with our students and our school.
            </p>
            <p>
              We strive to get our students the most information possible so they can grow and learn as future computer scientists, journalists, business owners, designers, and much more. We use our resources and outreach to get our students even more experience and further their interests in these fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our goal is to be a part of the programming and gaming community as a legitimate source of information and growth. Our team is always welcome to new article ideas and projects.

            </p>
            <p>
              We want our students to be able to be a part of the community and have information that we can use to build up more projects to change the world
