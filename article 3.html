  <h1>
<center>How Prison Architect Relates to the Current Prison System</center>
  </h1>
  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p>Whether that be the newest war simulator, or a complex simulation like SimCity, people like games they can relate to and control. The easiest way for game developers to do that is to base a storyline on real-world experiences, something that gives the player the ability to change and decide their fate. The problem with this concept is the statement it makes on considering violent and sadistic these games tend to be. The idea is to grab people and suck them into playing this way, which isn't a new concept, can have some interesting and scary outcomes.
  From the outside, private prisons screams reform and good intentions. People paying for bad actions by doing community service to further their community and self worth. From the inside, a  private prison or for-profit prison is defined as “a place in which individuals are physically confined or incarcerated by a third party that is contracted by a government agency.”But in reality private prisons rake in $3.3 billion in annual revenue and institute “Low-crime-taxes,” giving them the ability to sue the government for being under capacity.  This poses the question,“how innocent is our current prison system?”
   Imprisonment as a form of criminal punishment became widespread in the United States just before the American Revolution. Penal incarceration efforts had been ongoing in England since as early as the 1500s, and prisons in the form of dungeons and various detention facilities had existed since long before. Nowadays there are 2.3 million people currently incarcerated in the US alone, according to Bureau of Justice statistics.
  Released in 2012 by the Introversion Software, the video game Prison Architect describes itself as, “the world's latest Prison Management Sim. Starting with an empty plot of land you must construct a holding cell with basic water and electricity to house your first batch of prisoners, to buy you enough time to create a proper cell block. You’ll need a canteen, infirmary, guard room, a workout area? Or even some solitary confinement cells and an execution chamber?”. The game opens with the story of Edward, a man facing the electric chair for a vicious murder. The game follows the stories of four prisoners in all, from Mafia Dons to power-crazed senators, and it’s the player’s job to keep them locked up and stop them from escaping.</p>
  <h2>RELATIONS</h2>
  	<p>Although the game is full of cute, fictional AI characters, one can’t ignore the overarching concepts of death, violence, gangs, and how it relates to the current prison system.
  Throughout the game, the player is exposed to a common theme of violence and hostility. Hostility is shown everywhere from the riots and the secret weapons hidden by the inmates to the precautions put in place to prevent escape. After loading up the game, the player is launched into the story of Edward. Edward is accused of the violent murder of his wife and the man she was cheating with. After a basic prison is built, the player is instructed to build an execution chamber to “deal” with the inmate.  Once you have completed the task and have a hold on your prison the game throws a curveball and has the inmates revolt. The player can triple the guards and add guard dogs, but the prisoners start hiding weapons, causing havoc, and eventually turning into a full-out riot. The player must put out fires, prevent casualties and keep the overall peace.
  It may be legal in most places, but that doesn't stop the concept of the death penalty from being highly controversial. As of August 2017, capital punishment is legal in 31 US states. “Since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated by the US Supreme Court, 1,458 people have been executed (as of July 28, 2017).”  This extreme measure of punishment has the country tworn, is it the right of a jury or judge to decide who lives and who dies. “A prison riot is an act of concerted defiance or disorder by a group of prisoners against the prison administrators, prison officers, or other groups of prisoners in attempt to force change or express a grievance.” analyses of prison riots tend to put an emphasis on the connection of riots and the prisoners living conditions. Riots have been initiated for any number of reasons, anything from food quality, to education standards, to overcrowding (as seen in the game). Hundreds have been killed in over 40 riots in the united states alone.
  A hidden feature of the game, tucked away in the menu bar is the “Escape mode”.
  “Finished your supermax? Got guard dogs roving every corridor and prisoners eating out of your hand? Now you can live the horror by firing up escape mode and play as a prisoner hell-bent on getting the hell out of dodge. Dig a tunnel, go for the armoury or start a riot and slip out in the chaos, it’s entirely up to you! Figure out how to escape from your own creation, or hit the random button and load one of the 12,000 prisons created by the steam community”
  The idea of the justice system is a two-part initiative. First, to keep criminals out off the streets so they are unable to harm the general populous as well as punishment for illegal acts. The second part is reform. The problem with this is that 77 percent of released prisoners are rearrested within five years.
  The game doesn't start with just the inner working of the prison system, but takes it further making one of the main premises of this game money. The player starts off with 30 thousand to spend on a basic facility. The goal is to house a starting count of 15 “medium” prisoners, with an additional $500 earned for every medium prisoner added to the prison. This brings a prisoner to money ratio, letting the player earn money off locking more people up. Some wardens will even have the “special ability” to make a profit off contraband found in their prison.
  The concept of making money off prisons is not new to our prison system, America’s for-profit prison industry controls 126,000 Americans’ lives, making it a $5 billion sector. A couple years ago, privately owned prisons started institution “lockup quotas” that translates to an occupacity percentage. Prisons like these negotiate a percentage of how full the facility has to be, that number can range from 70% all the way to 100% capacity. When the government can’t provide those numbers prisons are entitled to a fee for the empty beds. If the prison is making its quota of prisoners they are still making money off people being incarcerated.</p>
  <h2>STATEMENT</h2>
  <p>Although it may not be apparent at first glance there is a critical statement the game is making on our current justice system. As previously stated, games are proven to be successful when they are both something the player can relate to and control. This game brings both to light, and it lets the player decide. Not only that, prison architect takes these hard concepts and makes them simple. This is shown by starting off the story mode jumping directly into an execution. It's also shown through the hostility of the guards, the riots, and the overall violence. The game demonstrates gangs vs gangs, and prisoners vs guards. Although most likely not intentionally, the game also makes a statement on profiting off the prison system. The biggest concept this game displays is the ability to play the game how you want to, whether you run the prison by being kind or by force. It's this kind of media outputs that speak to how one approaches and fixes a problem without the idea of repercussions or morals.</p>
